Hello! This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, which showcases the work I have completed in UX, Web, and Visual design. The website is modified and tested locally using GitHub Desktop, and then uploaded to this repository. The repository is connected to Netlify, which hosts it at the domain https://www.zachgreenbaum.com. Feel free to check it out!
